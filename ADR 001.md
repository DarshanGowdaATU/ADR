# Using Docker for Wednesday_Adventures

### Status
Proposed

### Context
Development testing and deployment activities of the "Wednesday_Adventures" project depend on a steady, repeatable environment. Through Docker technology, the application maintains consistent operation across multiple environments because it packages the complete environment framework with all its dependencies. The deployment process becomes more straightforward by using Docker because CI/CD pipelines can run efficiently.

The objective is to establish an isolated Docker space which enables dependable application execution from development through production stages, combined with quick and easy deployment steps.

### Decision
The objective is to establish an isolated Docker space that enables dependable application execution from development through production stages, combined with quick and easy deployment steps.

Our base image selection will rely on an official lightweight platform matching the application needs (Python, Node.js, etc.) for the particular environment. The current Dockerfile includes an appropriate base image, which likely comes from the Python or Node family, according to your project requirements for environmental compatibility.

During Docker image creation, the application dependencies will be automatically installed through a package manager, including pip and npm.

A Dockerfile should use multi-stage builds during development to optimize the final image by keeping essential files and dependencies only.

**Ports and Volumes:** The Docker container will expose the necessary ports, ensuring the application can be accessed appropriately. Volumes will be used for data persistence if necessary.

The CI/CD integration procedure will join the container image with automated deployment systems while performing application testing inside isolated spaces.

The system will receive security through exclusive permission granting to the container to prevent vulnerabilities. Image vulnerability detection will take place during the CI/CD process.

### Consequences

**Benefits:**

- The same environment preserves uniformity from development through deployment stages.
- The container system simplifies dependency management since it includes all resources inside its structure.
- Users can easily expand their solutions between cloud deployment and local hosting infrastructure.
- The solution establishes CI/CD delivery pipelines that drive better development productivity levels.

**Drawbacks:**

- Operating the image demands Docker knowledge for maintenance purposes.
- The Docker image becomes increasingly larger when dependencies accumulate, which leads to slower deployment and build processes.
- The operating system layer added by running containers creates extra abstract logic, resulting in enhanced potential complexity when debugging problems.

### Alternatives Considered
- A complete virtual machine solution could be used instead of Docker to achieve isolation. However, the Docker platform delivers quick and lightweight operation with its isolated features.
- Setting up the development environment by hand stands as one alternative, while Vagrant and manual installation represent another choice. However, this setup lacks the automated process and repeated management capabilities that Docker offers.
